# CppDiep

This is a very simple 2D game based on [Diep.io](https://diep.io/).
It is a personal project originally intended to be used as a reinforcement learning environment.
It might have been better to write this with the ECS pattern instead of OOP but I didn't know about ECS when I started this project.

## Building

Building this project requires Box2D 2.3 (not 2.4, which changed header names) and SFML 2.5.
Commands for Debian 11:
```bash
sudo apt install g++ make cmake libbox2d-dev libsfml-dev
git clone https://github.com/bkrl/cppdiep.git && cd cppdiep
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j $(nproc)
```
